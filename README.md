## Features
- When typing `{}` in a python string, automatically convert it to an f-string.
- When adding `${}` or a line break in a JavaScript string, automatically convert it to a template string. (Also works in related languages like JS-React or Typescript.)
- When *removing* the `{}`, `${}`, or line break, automatically convert it back to a regular string.
- Opt-in: Typing `%s` in a non-pattern lua string, automatically converts it to a formatted string. [However, take note of the the caveats for thos.](#special-case-formatted-strings-in-lua).
- Also works with multi-line strings.
- Zero configuration. Just install and you are ready to go.

## Requirements
- nvim 0.9 or higher.
- The respective Treesitter parsers: `:TSInstall python javascript typescript`.

## Installation

```lua
-- lazy.nvim
{ 
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-puppeteer",
	dependencies = "nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter",
	lazy = false, -- plugin lazy-loads itself. Can also load on filetypes.
},

-- packer
use {
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-puppeteer",
	requires = "nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter",
}
```

There is no `.setup()` call. The plugin already automatically loads as little as possible.

## Special Case: Formatted Strings in Lua
Through [string.format](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html#pdf-string.format), there are also formatted strings in Lua. However, auto-conversions are far more difficult in lua `%s` is used as a placeholder for `string.format` and [as class in lua patterns](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html#6.4.1) at the same time. While it is possible to identify in some cases whether a lua string is used as pattern, there are certain cases where that is not possible:

```lua
-- desired: conversion to format string when typing the placeholder "%s"
local str = "foobar %s baz" -- before
local str = ("foobar %s baz"):format() -- after

-- problem case that can be dealt with: "%s" used as class in lua pattern
local found = str:find("foobar %s")

-- problem case that cannot be dealt with: "%s" in string, which
-- is only later used as pattern
local pattern = "foobar %s baz"
-- some codeâ€¦
str:find(pattern)
```

Since the auto-conversion of lua strings can result in undesired false conversions, the feature is opt-in only. This way, you can decide for yourself whether the occasional false positive is worth it for you or not.

```lua
-- enable auto-conversion of lua strings (default: false)
vim.g.puppeteer_lua_format_string = true
```

> [!NOTE]
> After enabling, you can also set the variable to `false` temporarily to pause the auto-conversion. This can be useful if only one specific string gives you trouble.
